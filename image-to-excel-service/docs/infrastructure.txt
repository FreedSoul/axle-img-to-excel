INFRASTRUCTURE: AWS NATIVE SERVERLESS STACK (PATH 1)

The architecture is fully contained within AWS "Standard" services to ensure ease of deployment and security ("Native" integration).

1.  **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**
    - **Input Bucket**: Stores raw uploaded images. configured with event notifications.
    - **Output Bucket**: Stores the processed Excel/CSV files.
    - *Lifecycle Rules*: Recommended to set a 24-hour expiration rule to auto-delete files and save storage costs.

2.  **AWS Lambda (Compute)**
    - **Runtime**: Python 3.12
    - **Memory**: ~512MB (Sufficient for image handling and pandas manipulation).
    - **Timeout**: 30-60 seconds (Bedrock calls can take a few seconds).
    - **Dependencies**: `boto3` (native), plus a layer for `pandas` and `openpyxl`.

3.  **Amazon Bedrock (AI Platform)**
    - **Model**: `meta.llama3-2-11b-inst-v1:0` (Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct).
    - **Role**: Performs the Vision-to-Text extraction. No infrastructure management required by user.

4.  **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
    - **Lambda Execution Role**:
        - `s3:GetObject` (Input Bucket)
        - `s3:PutObject` (Output Bucket)
        - `bedrock:InvokeModel` (Access to Llama 3.2)
        - `logs:CreateLogGroup` (CloudWatch logging)

5.  **CloudWatch**
    - Stores logs for debugging Lambda executions.
